The handler is for storing the images inside a database, that is why each image takes up almost no space. 

IF YOUR ON WINDOWS:
You do not have to mess with handler

IF YOUR ON MAC:
Delete the regular handler, if you restart or shut down your mac before doing this, images may become corrupted.

We are working to fix this error on MacOS
