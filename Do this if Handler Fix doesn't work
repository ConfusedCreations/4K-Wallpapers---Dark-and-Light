First open the 4K wallpapers GitHub page, go to "Releases", go to "Tags", and then find and press the tag that says "DataB7".
Download the zip file inside the release and open your files.
Extract the "MacOS Data B7" zip into the "MacOS Fix" folder inside the 4K wallpapers folder.
Then you can close your files and open them back up again, your files should be higher quality! 
If not, then restart you computer.
